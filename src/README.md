# Wordle
## CSCE 314 Final Project

##### This project is based on integrating Java with GUI programming using JavaFX. 
##### It is a Wordle game, which is a puzzle game where players guess a hidden and random five-letter word.

### Rules: 
 - The player has 6 chances to guess the word.
 - The player can enter a guess of 5 letters.
 - If the letter is correct and in the correct position, it will be green.
 - If the letter is correct but in the wrong position, it will be yellow.
 - If the letter is not correct, it will be gray.
 - Once a letter has been grey'd, it cannot be used again.
 - The word list is randomly generated from a list of past Wordle words of 2310 words. 
 - If the player guesses the word correctly, they will see a "Congratulations" message and the game will end or the player can play again.
 - If the player runs out of chances, they will see a "Game Over" message and the game will end or the player can play again.

### Key Features:
- Name, Wins, Loss, and Average Guesses are all stored and displayed on the screen. 
- The player can reset the board at any time if they feel stuck at the current word. 
- The player can use the on-screen keyboard as well as their device's keyboard to play the game.
- The game will store the most recent user's statistics! (They must use the same user name).
